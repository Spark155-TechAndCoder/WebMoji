# WebMoji
Welcome to the emoji library that defies expectations. Feeling fancy? Throw on the Person in a White Shirtâ€”they look like they just came from an office meeting or a fashion runway. This library isnâ€™t just a collection, itâ€™s a lifestyle. The weird, the wild, the questionableâ€¦ all in one place. ðŸŒŸ
# ReadMe
Installation

To get started with your journey into peak emoji culture, simply download the files and drop them into your project, Discord server, or anywhere emojis are used. Itâ€™s that easyâ€”just like the vast emptiness of the Blank Emoji.

Clone this repo:
`git clone https://github.com/Spark155-TechAndCoder/WebMoji.git`


Drop the emoji files wherever your heart desires (preferably in a fun place).

Add some flair to your chats, games, and life. ðŸ’¥

# Usage

For Discord: Just drag and drop these bad boys into your serverâ€™s emoji settings and let the chaos ensue.
For Games: Use them as your gameâ€™s emoji assets to truly express every possible emotion.

For Life: Need an emoji to express your inner mood? Use the Blank Emoji to show that sometimes, silence speaks louder than words.

Why This Library?

Because you deserve emojis that reflect the full spectrum of human emotions, from the most sophisticated (hello, Person in a White Shirt) to the totally ridiculous (Middle Finger). Why settle for boring when you can have fancy, spicy, and cute all in one? Embrace the randomness, the sass, and the simplicityâ€”it's your emoji world, weâ€™re just living in it. ðŸŒŽâœ¨
